Tip Calculator


When you go out to eat, you always tip 20% of the bill amount. But who’s got the time to calculate the right tip amount every time? Not you that’s for sure! You’re making a program to calculate tips and save some time.

Your program needs to take the bill amount as input and output the tip as a float.


#Solution:

bill = int(input())
#your code goes here
tip=float(bill*20/100)

print(tip)
