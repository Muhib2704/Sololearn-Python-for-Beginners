Sum of Consecutive Numbers


No one likes homework, but your math teacher has given you an assignment to find the sum of the first N numbers.

Let’s save some time by creating a program to do the calculation for you!

Take a number N as input and output the sum of all numbers from 1 to N (including N).

N = int(input())

#your code goes here
sum=0

num=list(range(1,N+1))

for i in num:
   sum+=i
   
print(sum)
